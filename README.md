# OCP_bridge_function

This repository containst the bridge function data resulting from the Molecular Dynamics simulations published in the work [Bridge functions of classical one-component plasmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09574)


Each text file contains the raw data of the average bridge functions and standard deviations of the average bridge functions for one of the 17 state points of interest in the full non-trivial range.
